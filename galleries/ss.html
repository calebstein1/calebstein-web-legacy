		<p style="color:#B6B6B4">Soviet Seattle is an exploration in creating scenes of a different era out of images of modern-day Seattle. The theme of Soviet Seattle seemed especially apt at the time these shots were taken (early autumn, 2020), as that was during a time when the entire city of Seattle at once turned to embrace many Soviet policies. I created these images by shooting Harbor Island on expired Ilford HP-4 film and printed very long exposures on Soviet Union-made BromPortret paper. Due to extremely poor quality-control of the paper, each print is one-of-a-kind and not ever able to be reproduced.</p>
