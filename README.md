# calebstein-web-legacy

The source code for my first ever website I created, that I found recently in my ~/Documents folder.

We're talking straight-up plain HTML; no scripting; minimal inline styles; depricated tags galore; and a table being used as a navigation bar, copy and pasted across every page.

Obviously this is nothing special, but it shows how far I've developed in a relatively short period of time, and frankly, it's nostalgic to me so I wanted to share it.
